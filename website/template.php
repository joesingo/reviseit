			A <span class="bold">set</span> is a group of terms and definitions about a subject or topic (or whatever you want).
			You can share your sets with everyone using the site, with specific users or no one at all. If you choose to share your
			set other people can find it by searching by set name or by subject tags.

			On the view set page you can play games/quizzes to test your knowledge. On the same page you can view a graph showing your
			scores for a particular game with the set and view highscores from all users allowed to view the set.
